Hello! I'm an MS student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute(WPI). I have an innate passion for understanding how human perception and control works and how I can build vision-based motion planning architectures and reinforcement learning-aided control techniques for autonomous systems to empower people through my work. In pursuit of this passion, I am very interested in research on Perception, Controls, Motion Planning, Cognitive science, and their application to Robotics
I recently received a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [VJTI Mumbai, India](https://vjti.ac.in/). During my undergrad, I had the pleasure to intern at [IIT Ropar AWaDH](https://ihub-awadh.in/) and [IIT Bombay ARMS lab](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/).

I'm grateful to have wonderful mentors and collaborators including [Vikas Phalle](http://vikasphalle.com/), [Dhiraj Mahajan](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/smmee/dhiraj), [Arpita Sinha](https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/arpitasinha), [Krishna Murthy](https://krrish94.github.io/) and other awesome researchers!

Apart from research, I'm a huge fan of the Indian Army and find recreation in music, entrepreneurship, and gaming.
